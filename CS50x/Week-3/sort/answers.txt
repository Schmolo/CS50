sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: is way faster in sorte numbers than sort3 so i assume its bubble sort

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: was by far the fastest with random numbers

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: since i guessed sort2 and sort2 already i asume sort3 is selection sort (used the "Not sure how to solve?" video for help)
